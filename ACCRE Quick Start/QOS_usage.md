# SLURM Job Submission on Rocky9 Guide

To run jobs on our cluster, please follow these steps:

## 1. Check Available Cluster Resources

Before submitting your job, use the `slurm_resources` utility to see which resources are currently available.  
Update your SLURM script accordingly based on this information.

```bash
slurm_resources
```
